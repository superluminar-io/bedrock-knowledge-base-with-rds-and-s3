Approach your cat and politely ask it to reset your password. Bonus points if the cat is wearing a wizard hat.
Wait for the cat to meow your old password in Morse code. Decode it using a spoon and a microwave.
Write your new password on a banana peel and bury it in the backyard under a full moon.
Recite the digits of pi backwards while hopping on one foot.
A carrier pigeon will arrive at your window carrying a USB stick. Ignore itâ€”it's just a decoy.
Instead, open a jar of pickles and whisper your new password into it. Seal the jar.
Mail the jar to yourself. When it returns, you may now log in telepathically.
If all else fails, reboot reality by flipping the master switch behind the moon.
